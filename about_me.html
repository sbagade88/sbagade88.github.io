  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <img src="img/me.jpg" alt="my Image">

  <p style="text-align:center"> My name is Sonia Bagade, I am senior Bachelors degree student at UNO, major in Management Information System and Concentration in Information Assurance. I am really looking forward to learn New Programming Language - Python and Django. I am currently working as an automation test engineer intern at an Insurance firm located in Omaha Metro. I am planning to graduate in August 2023. We work in Agile environment.

  I love the fact that computer technology has evolved a lot and that fascinates me. We get to learn new skills on every stage of our career. As an individual who work in IT, I need to be on my toes to learn the changes in the technology and my learning curve is very steep.

  My strength would be that I always learned new things going out of my comfort zone. Actually, I have Bachelors degree in Commerce, however, I shifted to IT and I am close to accomplish my goal that is graduating in Information systems and also working in the same field.

  For fun I like to watch Netflix, travel some nice and warm places, just chill spending time with family. The travel has been very limited for me from past 2 years due to the pandemic. As the things looks easing out little bit I am expecting more traveling this year going forward.</p>
